[{"contentType":1,"data":{"content":["Video footage of a girl wearing an ‘L O V E’ skirt positioned in the corner of a 3x2 studio space. Once the recording device is turned on, the girl incorporates acts similar to that of triggering explosive devices; guns and grenades. The girl employs a selection of six ‘air-guns’ to facilitate her physical conduct: 3 machine guns, pistol/hand-gun, and 2 shotguns, each with a unique sound, simultaneously shot & vocally interpreted by the girl. Sampled audio bites are overlaid to enhance the impact of these acts, elevating its artificiality. The act ends and the girl reverts to a neutral stance in the studio corner and turns off the recording device.","(line break)","(line break)"]}},{"contentType":4,"data":"https://vimeo.com/112134680"}]
